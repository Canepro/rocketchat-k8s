# Promtail Configuration
# Promtail is a log shipper that collects logs from Kubernetes pods and sends them to a central Loki instance.
# This ConfigMap defines how Promtail discovers pods, reads their logs, and formats them for Loki.
# See VERSIONS.md for version tracking and update procedures.

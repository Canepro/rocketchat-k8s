# Promtail DaemonSet
# Promtail runs as a DaemonSet (one pod per node) to collect logs from all Kubernetes pods.
# Each Promtail pod reads log files from its host node's /var/log/pods directory and ships them to Loki.
# See VERSIONS.md for version tracking. Latest version: v3.6.0 (Note: Promtail is deprecated in favor of Grafana Alloy after March 2026)

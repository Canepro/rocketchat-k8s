# Promtail RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
# These RBAC resources grant Promtail the necessary Kubernetes API permissions to:
# 1. Discover pods and namespaces (for log file discovery)
# 2. Access node information (for log path construction)
# 3. Watch for pod changes (to automatically discover new pods)
